I get it but you have to let go of the past to move forward. Past cannot be changed, only your present.",

However , the best way is to say ok , i did it , learned from it , will not do that again . ever ! ! ! you can get past it ; grow from it . Unfortunately , we forgive others faster than we do ourselves because we hold ourselves to higher standards or expect better behavior from ourselves . it can be embarrassing , hurtful , almost unforgiving at times . But how do you forgive yourself ? take a deep breathe . . . . . and then acknowledge that you did something wrong , acknowledge it , and say to self , \" i forgive me \" . just like you would say to someone else . this starts the process of forgiving . also ask yourself these questions : what lesson did i learn ? What would I have done differently ? What will be a trigger that will make me do that again , if I happen to be weak or tempted ? avoid or prepare for those triggers . . . . forgiving yourself will set you free from the prison you have put yourself in . you would start back living ."
